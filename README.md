# MIPS Single-Cycle Processor

A Modular implementation of a 32-bit single-cycle MIPS processor written in Verilog. The processor completes all five instruction stages—fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back—in a single clock cycle.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the core architecture of a MIPS processor using hardware description language (Verilog). It supports basic MIPS instructions and provides an integrated datapath and control unit design suitable for simulation and learning purposes.

## ⚙️ Components Description

- **ALU (`alu.v`)**: Performs arithmetic and logic operations.
- **Register File (`register_file.v`)**: 32 registers with 2 read and 1 write port. Register `$zero` is hardwired to 0.
- **Control Unit (`control_unit.v`)**: Generates control signals based on opcode and funct fields.
- **Program Counter (`program_counter.v`)**: Holds the address of the current instruction.
- **Instruction Memory (`instruction_memory.v`)**: Contains hardcoded instruction set in hex.
- **Data Memory (`data_memory.v`)**: Allows `lw` and `sw` for word-level memory operations.

## 🚀 Simulation Instructions

### 🧪 Run Simulation

1. **Navigate to root directory**:
   ```bash
   cd MIPS-Single-Cycle-Processor
   ```

2. **Compile the design and testbench**:
   ```bash
   iverilog -o mips.vvp top.v modules/*.v testbench/tb_top.v
   ```

3. **Run the simulation**:
   ```bash
   vvp mips.vvp
   ```

## 📌 Example Use Case

You can preload the instruction memory with a small program performing the following:

```assembly
addi $t0, $zero, 5
addi $t1, $zero, 10
add  $t2, $t0, $t1
sw   $t2, 0($zero)
```

This will add two numbers and store the result in memory at address 0.
